1. Default bridge
By default a virtual network interface is given usually 172.17.0.1/16
containers are given ip -> 172.17.X.X/16
Containers can reach to each other as they are in the same virtual network.

2. Use defined bridge
We can create separate user defined virtual network usually 172.18.0.1/16 and so on.
Commands: docker network create <name>
This mode gives isolation.
Running containers on two different virtual networks are isolated.

3. Host mode
In this mode the containers share Host machine ip and ports.
Containers feel like native application like.  

4. MacVlan
Using this mode separate mac address is assigned to the containers and
appear as individual peer in the LAN(real network), gets ip
address using DHCP. Same like VMs in Bridge Adapter mode.
But this mode is very easy to setup.

*Mainly the userdefined bridge mode is mostly used and recommended and the default bridge one too.
