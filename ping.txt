You run: ping example.com

Your computer sends a small packet of data called an ICMP echo request to the target (example.com in this case).

The target computer responds with an ICMP echo reply.

ping measures the round-trip time (RTT) — how long it took for the packet to go there and back.

It repeats this multiple times (usually until you stop it with Ctrl+C) and shows:

Time taken in milliseconds

Packet loss (if some requests didn’t get a reply)

Statistics like min/avg/max round-trip time

✅ Simple summary:

Check connectivity: Does the target respond?

Measure latency: How fast is the network to that target?

Troubleshoot network issues: High latency or packet loss can indicate problems.
